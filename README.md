## Brahmesh (Brahme)

Nothing more to explain here.
My **LinkedIn** and **GitHub** speak better than I can.

### Learning Phase
The phase where I needed to explain what I know is done.
My learning, progress, and consistency are already visible through my work.

You can check my **LinkedIn** and **GitHub** to understand how I think, build, and grow.

### Current Situation
I'am working very closely with **senior software engineers, DevOps engineers, product managers, and senior architects** in a startup.
I’m incredibly happy to be part of this team.

Being surrounded by people at this level is pushing me forward faster than any isolated learning ever could. I’m confident this environment is keeping me **4–5 years ahead** in terms of real-world engineering exposure and system thinking.


### Future
Teaching has always been close to my heart.

Everything I learn—through hard work, real-world experience, and years of building systems—I plan to pass on to curious learners who genuinely want to understand technology, not just use it.
